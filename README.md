# image_segmentation

We intend to perform image segmentation. Image segmentation means that we can group 
similar pixels together and give these grouped pixels the same label. The grouping problem is a 
clustering problem. We want to study the use of K-means on the Berkeley Segmentation 
Benchmark. 

Dataset used is 
http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/BSR/BSR_bsds500.tgz

This a direct implementation of k-means and spectral clustering to compare between the results of each one of them.
